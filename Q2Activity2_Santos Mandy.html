		<h1>Body of Woman</h1>
		<h2>Pablo Neruda</h2>

	<div class="Paragraphs">
	<p id="Para1">Body of woman, white hills, white thighs,<br>
	You look like the world in your attitude of surrender.<br>
	My body of savage peasantry is undercutting you.<br>
	And makes the child jump from the bottom of the earth</p>
	<p>I was just like a tunnel.The birds were fleeing from me.<br>
	And in me the night entered its powerful invasion.<br>
	To survive I forged you as a weapon,<br>
	Like an arrow in my bow, like a stone in my sling.</p>
	<p>But the hour of revenge falls, and I love you.<br>
	Body of skin, moss, avid and firm milk.<br>
	Ah the chest cups! In the eyes of absence!<br>
	Ah, the pubic roses! Ah your slow and sad voice!</p>
	<p class="Para4">Body of my woman, will persist in your grace.<br>
	My thirst, my anxiety without limit, my way undecided!<br>
	Dark channels where the eternal thirst follows,<br>
	And the fatigue follows, and the infinite pain.</p>
